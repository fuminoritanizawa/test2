  Participated in [Professor Supriya Srinivasan's molecular neuroscience lab](https://www.srinivasanlab.org) focused on metabolism
- Designed and cloned tissue-specific rescue constructs for *Caenorhabditis elegans* to examine the function of a targeted gene using Gibson Assembly.
- Engineered a complete knockout of a gene of interest in the lab by deleting all six exons (approximately 3,500 base pairs), designing the necessary sgRNA and PAM, creating an EcoRI cutting site repair template, and developing a screening strategy using Co-CRISPR with the dpy-10 gene (dpy/rol phenotype marker).
- Developed a worm strain by crossbreeding a gene mutation line with a rescue construct line of the targeted gene marked with green fluorescent protein (GFP).
- Conducted imaging of NeuroPAL line and GFP-crossbred product worms using an A1 Confocal Microscope.

  Collaborated with [Prof. Mark Ilton's team](https://posmlab.org) on a biophysical research project, modeling both hardware and software aspects of Conus marmoreus injection latch.
  - Studied the mechanical characterization of elastic biological materials, crucial for animal locomotion, which exhibit a highly non-linear mechanical response and are rate-dependent due to complex dynamic relaxation processes.
  - Conducted recoil experiments to characterize the high-rate, large deformation response of elastic materials, involving stretching a clamped material, measuring force and displacement, then releasing the material and measuring the recoil using high-speed videography.
  - Analyzed the dynamics of elastic energy release to infer the high-rate and large deformation mechanical properties of the material.
  - Contributed to ongoing efforts to develop a methodology for inferring mechanical properties from recoil experiments, enabling the characterization of elastic biological materials during ultrafast movement.
