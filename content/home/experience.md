- Developed tissue-specific rescue constructs to investigate the role of a gene of interest. **Skills:** designing plasmids using SnapGene and WormBase, PCR, gel extraction, Gibson assembly, competent cell transformation, and miniprep.
- Engineered a global knockout of a lab-interest gene, involving the deletion of all six exons (approximately 3,500 base pairs). **Skills:** designing appropriate sgRNA and PAM, creating a repair template with an EcoRI cutting site, and developing a screening strategy using Co-CRISPR with the dpy-10 gene (dpy/rol phenotype marker).
- Created a worm strain by crossing a gene mutation line with a rescue construct line of the gene of interest labeled with green fluorescent protein. **Skills:** worm crossing, genotyping, and fluorescence microscopy with green fluorescent protein.
- Performed imaging of NeuroPAL line and GFP-crossed product worms using an A1 Confocal Microscope.**Skills:** confocal microscopy imaging with multiple laser channels.
