Hello! I'm Fumi, a Computational Biology student from Harvey Mudd. My passion is in unraveling the genetic mechanisms of animal adaptation to environmental stress, particularly in longevity studies. My journey so far includes decoding fruit fly genetics, tracing butterfly evolution, and exploring C. elegans' neuroscience. Always on the lookout for exciting learning opportunities!
