Hi, I’m Fumi, a senior at Harvey Mudd majoring in Computational Biology. Driven by a passion for advancing human health, I’m focused on becoming a molecular geneticist specializing in infectious diseases. I’ve developed my expertise through internships at Scripps Research, Johns Hopkins Medicine, and the National University of Singapore. My primary focus is on infectious disease, particularly parasitology and neglected tropical diseases. I aspire to lead transformative research that redefines our understanding and treatment of these critical health challenges.
