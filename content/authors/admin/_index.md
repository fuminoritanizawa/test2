Hi! I’m Fumi Tanizawa, a senior at Harvey Mudd College majoring in Computational Biology. I specialize in molecular genetics and regenerative medicine, with research experience at Johns Hopkins Medicine, Scripps Research, and Shizuoka University. My interests include molecular immunology and genetic medicine, focusing on neglected tropical diseases. My big dream is to lead groundbreaking basic research that transforms our understanding and treatment of genetic diseases.

I've been honored with full-ride scholarships from the <a href ="https://www.yanaitadashi-foundation.or.jp/en/">Tadashi Yanai Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://masason-foundation.org/en/">Masason Foundation</a>.
