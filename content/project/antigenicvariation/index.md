title: Characterizing the Effect of the Extravascular Environment on Trypanosoma brucei Antigenic Diversity
---

**Summer 2024 Research Project at Mugnier Lab, Johns Hopkins University**

My project investigated how *Trypanosoma brucei* evades human immune systems. This protozoan parasite is transmitted to humans and livestock through tsetse fly bites, posing significant public health and economic burdens in sub-Saharan Africa. It causes chronic infections through antigenic variation, a process in which the parasite periodically switches its variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat to escape recognition by host antibodies. While traditional research focuses on parasites in the bloodstream, recent studies suggest that extravascular spaces—areas between cells within tissues—serve as the primary reservoirs of antigenic diversity.

Our study aimed to optimize a protocol for extracting extracellular fluid (EF) from infected mice for downstream analyses, such as TMT proteomics and ELISA. By dissecting mice and collecting tissues like adipose tissue, heart, and lung, we developed methods to extract EF with minimal contamination using specific centrifugation speeds on a filter and techniques such as washing and perfusion. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that EF contained distinct protein components compared to cell lysate and serum. Additionally, ELISA conducted on EF showed lower levels of IgM and IgG, suggesting that lower immune pressure might be relevant to antigenic variation.

This optimized protocol provides a reliable method for EF extraction and enhances our understanding of the extravascular environment’s role in *Trypanosoma brucei* infection. Our findings could potentially contribute to a better understanding of the effect of extravascular spaces on the antigenic variation of parasites and how they evade immune systems.
