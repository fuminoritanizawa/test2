title: Characterizing the Effect of the Extravascular Environment on Trypanosoma brucei Antigenic Diversity
---

**Summer 2024 Research Project at Mugnier Lab, Johns Hopkins University**

My project investigated how Trypanosoma brucei invades human immune systems. This protozoan parasite poses a significant public health and economic burden in sub-Saharan Africa by causing chronic infections through antigenic variation. It periodically switches its variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat to escape recognition by host antibodies. While most research focuses on the bloodstream, studies suggest that extravascular spaces, areas between cells within tissues, serve as the primary reservoirs of antigenic diversity.

Our study aimed to optimize a protocol for extracting extracellular fluid (EF) from infected mice for analyses such as TMT proteomics and ELISA. By dissecting mice and collecting tissues like adipose tissue, heart, and lung, we developed methods to extract EF with minimal contamination using specific centrifugation speeds and techniques such as washing and perfusion. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that EF contained distinct protein components compared to cell lysate and serum.

This optimized protocol provides a reliable method for EF extraction and enhances our understanding of the extravascular environmentâ€™s role in Trypanosoma brucei infection. Our findings could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets, improving treatment strategies for this and other diseases.
